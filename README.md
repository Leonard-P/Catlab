AI to identify missing cats
# Our goal
With our Catlab AI we want to help missing cats and their owners. :D
Our goal is to speed up the identification of a found cat by uploading a picture of it in the corresponding app or website which then displays lost reports with similar looking cats. In this way even non-chiped/tattooed cats can be identified within seconds. It is also an improvement in terms of identifying marked cats, as the AI makes it possible to identify it without requiring tools such as chip readers, therefore saving the trip to the shelter or vet.
